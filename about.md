# About Brackets & Blueprints

## The Philosophy

**Preparing for a technical interview?** This blog is designed for you.

Every post takes a complex technical concept and explains it through a powerful analogy, then distills it into the essential knowledge you need. Not fluff, just the core concepts, comparison points, and talking points that matter in interviews.

When you truly master something, you can explain it simply. These posts are proof you understand it.

## Why This Matters

Technical interviews aren't about memorizing facts, they're about demonstrating understanding. You need to:
- Explain concepts clearly and concisely
- Compare trade-offs with confidence
- Know when and how to apply your knowledge
- Back up your answers with code examples

This blog gives you exactly that: concise, clear explanations paired with the comparisons and code you need to discuss in interviews.

## The Format

Each post is **interview-focused and concise** (5-10 minutes read time):

1. **The Problem** - What makes this concept confusing?
2. **The Analogy** - A relatable comparison from everyday life
3. **Quick Comparison** - Side-by-side comparison table
4. **Code Examples** - Practical, minimal code snippets
5. **When to Use** - Clear guidance on when and how to apply this
6. **Key Interview Points** - The talking points you need to know

## About Me
