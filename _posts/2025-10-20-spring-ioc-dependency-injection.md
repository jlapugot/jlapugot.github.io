## The Problem

What's the difference between IoC and DI? They're related but not the same. IoC is the principle, DI is the implementation.

---

## The Analogy

**Without IoC:** Chef goes to market, buys ingredients, manages inventory - controlling everything.

**With IoC:** Restaurant manager provides ingredients to the chef. Chef focuses on cooking, not shopping.

- **IoC** = The restaurant manager managing everything (framework controls flow)
- **DI** = The kitchen staff delivering ingredients (how dependencies get delivered)

## Three Ways to Inject Dependencies

**Constructor Injection (Best):**
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
}
```
- Immutable, required dependencies, easy to test

**Setter Injection:**
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private PaymentService paymentService;

    @Autowired
    public void setPaymentService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
}
```
- Optional dependencies, can change after creation

**Field Injection (Avoid):**
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private PaymentService paymentService;  // Hard to test
}
```
- Don't use in production code

## How Spring Does It

```java
// 1. Define what Spring can inject
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public PaymentService paymentService() {
        return new StripePayment();
    }
}

// 2. Ask for what you need
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
}

// 3. Spring automatically wires it together
```

## Key Interview Points

1. **IoC** = Framework controls your code flow
2. **DI** = How framework delivers dependencies
3. **Constructor injection is preferred** - Makes dependencies explicit
4. **Spring's IoC container** = ApplicationContext (creates and manages beans)
5. **You declare dependencies** â†’ Spring figures out how to provide them

## TL;DR

IoC is the principle (framework controls flow). DI is how it works (dependencies are injected). Use constructor injection. Let Spring manage the complexity.
