## The Problem

What's the difference between IoC and DI? They're related but not the same. IoC is the principle, DI is the implementation.

---

## The Analogy

**Without IoC: Chef is self-sufficient but fragile**

A chef needs tomatoes, olive oil, and pasta to cook dinner.

Without IoC, the chef does it all:
- Morning: Go to the market and buy tomatoes
- Afternoon: Go to another store for olive oil
- Evening: Go to a third store for pasta
- Finally: Cook dinner at 11 PM

Problem: If the tomato supplier changes, the chef needs to know the new location. If the supplier stops selling tomatoes, the chef's entire operation breaks. Chef is tightly coupled to suppliers.

**With IoC: Restaurant manager handles dependencies**

Same chef, but now there's a restaurant manager.

Chef says: "I need tomatoes, olive oil, and pasta."

The manager handles it:
- Manager sources tomatoes from a supplier
- Manager sources olive oil from a supplier
- Manager sources pasta from a supplier
- At 6 PM, manager puts all ingredients on the chef's counter
- Chef: "Ingredients are ready? Great! Cooking now."

If the tomato supplier changes? Manager finds a new one. Chef doesn't care.

**The Key Difference:**
- **Without IoC:** Chef controls everything. Tightly coupled. Hard to change. Fragile.
- **With IoC:** Manager (Spring) controls flow. Chef focuses on one thing: cooking. Loosely coupled. Easy to test and change.

**IoC = Inversion of Control** (framework controls flow, not your code)
**DI = Dependency Injection** (how dependencies are delivered to your code)

## Three Ways to Inject Dependencies

**Constructor Injection (Best):**
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
}
```
- Immutable, required dependencies, easy to test

**Setter Injection:**
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private PaymentService paymentService;

    @Autowired
    public void setPaymentService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
}
```
- Optional dependencies, can change after creation

**Field Injection (Avoid):**
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private PaymentService paymentService;  // Hard to test
}
```
- Don't use in production code

## How Spring Does It

```java
// 1. Define what Spring can inject
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public PaymentService paymentService() {
        return new StripePayment();
    }
}

// 2. Ask for what you need
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
}

// 3. Spring automatically wires it together
```

## Key Interview Points

1. **IoC** = Framework controls your code flow
2. **DI** = How framework delivers dependencies
3. **Constructor injection is preferred** - Makes dependencies explicit
4. **Spring's IoC container** = ApplicationContext (creates and manages beans)
5. **You declare dependencies** â†’ Spring figures out how to provide them

## TL;DR

IoC is the principle (framework controls flow). DI is how it works (dependencies are injected). Use constructor injection. Let Spring manage the complexity.
