## The Problem

Your application starts with one thread handling everything. But when should you create more threads? How many threads should you create? What happens to threads after they finish work? Creating too many threads wastes resources and slows down your application. Creating too few threads creates bottlenecks. Understanding thread creation, lifecycle, and management is critical for building performant, scalable applications.

## The Analogy

**Think of Java threads like call center operations.**

### Single Thread - One Operator Handling Everything

Imagine a call center with just **one operator**:
- Operator answers first call
- While on that call, other callers wait on hold
- After finishing, operator takes next call
- Only one conversation at a time
- Long wait times for customers

This is **single-threaded execution** - the main thread handles everything sequentially.

<div class="mermaid">
sequenceDiagram
    participant C1 as Caller 1
    participant Op as Operator (Main Thread)
    participant C2 as Caller 2
    participant C3 as Caller 3

    C1->>Op: Call arrives
    Op->>Op: Handling call...
    C2->>Op: Call arrives (waiting)
    C3->>Op: Call arrives (waiting)
    Op->>C1: Call complete
    Op->>C2: Now handling...
    Op->>Op: Handling call...
    Op->>C2: Call complete
    Op->>C3: Now handling...
</div>

```java
// Single-threaded call center
public class CallCenter {
    public void handleCall(String caller) {
        System.out.println("Handling call from " + caller);
        // Simulate call duration
        try { Thread.sleep(5000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        System.out.println("Finished call with " + caller);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CallCenter center = new CallCenter();
        center.handleCall("Alice");  // Takes 5 seconds
        center.handleCall("Bob");    // Waits, then takes 5 seconds
        center.handleCall("Carol");  // Waits, then takes 5 seconds
        // Total time: 15 seconds!
    }
}
```

### Creating Additional Threads - Hiring More Operators

When calls pile up, the **manager spawns additional operators**:
- Manager sees incoming calls exceeding capacity
- **Hires new operator** (creates new thread)
- Each operator handles one call independently
- Multiple conversations happen simultaneously
- Much shorter wait times

This is **multi-threaded execution** - creating worker threads to parallelize work.

<div class="mermaid">
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Manager (Main Thread)
    participant O1 as Operator 1 (Thread 1)
    participant O2 as Operator 2 (Thread 2)
    participant O3 as Operator 3 (Thread 3)
    participant C1 as Caller 1
    participant C2 as Caller 2
    participant C3 as Caller 3

    M->>O1: Spawn operator
    M->>O2: Spawn operator
    M->>O3: Spawn operator

    par Concurrent Calls
        O1->>C1: Handle call
        O2->>C2: Handle call
        O3->>C3: Handle call
    end

    O1->>M: Finished
    O2->>M: Finished
    O3->>M: Finished
</div>

```java
// Multi-threaded call center
public class CallCenter {
    public void handleCall(String caller) {
        System.out.println("Handling call from " + caller +
                          " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try { Thread.sleep(5000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        System.out.println("Finished call with " + caller);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CallCenter center = new CallCenter();

        // Manager spawns 3 operators (threads)
        Thread operator1 = new Thread(() -> center.handleCall("Alice"));
        Thread operator2 = new Thread(() -> center.handleCall("Bob"));
        Thread operator3 = new Thread(() -> center.handleCall("Carol"));

        operator1.start();  // Start working
        operator2.start();  // Start working
        operator3.start();  // Start working

        // All three calls handled simultaneously!
        // Total time: ~5 seconds instead of 15!
    }
}
```

### Thread Pools - Permanent Staff on Standby

Instead of hiring/firing operators for every call, maintain a **pool of permanent staff**:
- Keep 10 operators on standby (thread pool)
- Incoming calls get assigned to available operators
- When operator finishes, they're ready for next call
- No hiring/firing overhead
- Operators reused efficiently

This is **thread pooling** with `ExecutorService` - reusing threads efficiently.

        System.out.println("Handling call from " + caller +
                          " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try { Thread.sleep(5000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        System.out.println("Finished call with " + caller);
    }

    public void submitCall(String caller) {
        // Assign call to available operator from pool
        operatorPool.submit(() -> handleCall(caller));
    }

    public void shutdown() {
        operatorPool.shutdown();  // Close call center gracefully
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CallCenter center = new CallCenter();

        // 100 calls submitted
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            center.submitCall("Caller-" + i);
        }

        center.shutdown();
        // Pool handles all calls efficiently with just 10 threads!
    }
}
```

### How It Maps

| Call Center Concept | Java Thread Concept | Key Point |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **One operator** | Main thread | Sequential execution |
| **Hiring new operator** | `new Thread()` and `start()` | Creating new thread |
| **Operator working** | Thread in RUNNABLE state | Actively executing |
| **Operator on break** | Thread in WAITING state | Blocked on resource |
| **Firing operator** | Thread termination | Thread completes run() |
| **Pool of permanent staff** | ExecutorService/ThreadPool | Reusing threads |
| **Call queue** | BlockingQueue | Tasks waiting for threads |
| **Manager deciding staffing** | JVM/OS Thread Scheduler | Which thread runs when |
| **Shift supervisor** | Thread.join() | Waiting for thread to finish |

## The Technical Deep Dive

### When Is a Second Thread Created?

A new thread is created when you explicitly tell Java to create one. **Java doesn't automatically create worker threads** - you must do it programmatically.

**Common scenarios that trigger thread creation:**

1. **Explicit Thread Creation**
```java
Thread newThread = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Worker thread created!");
});
newThread.start();  // <-- New thread created HERE
```

2. **ExecutorService Submission**
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
// Creates 5 threads immediately (or on first task)
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task running"));
```

3. **Parallel Streams** (implicit thread creation)
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.parallelStream()  // Uses ForkJoinPool threads
       .forEach(System.out::println);
```

4. **Framework/Library Threads** (Spring, Tomcat, etc.)
```java
// Tomcat creates thread pool for handling HTTP requests
// Spring @Async creates threads for async methods
@Async
public void processAsync() {
    // Runs on separate thread from Spring's thread pool
}
```

### Thread Creation Methods

**Method 1: Extending Thread Class**

```java
public class CallOperator extends Thread {
    private String callerName;

    public CallOperator(String callerName) {
        this.callerName = callerName;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Handling call from " + callerName);
        try { Thread.sleep(5000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        System.out.println("Finished with " + callerName);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CallOperator op1 = new CallOperator("Alice");
        CallOperator op2 = new CallOperator("Bob");

        op1.start();  // Creates and starts thread
        op2.start();  // Creates and starts thread
    }
}
```

**Method 2: Implementing Runnable Interface** (PREFERRED)

```java
public class CallHandler implements Runnable {
    private String callerName;

    public CallHandler(String callerName) {
        this.callerName = callerName;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Handling call from " + callerName);
        try { Thread.sleep(5000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        System.out.println("Finished with " + callerName);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread op1 = new Thread(new CallHandler("Alice"));
        Thread op2 = new Thread(new CallHandler("Bob"));

        op1.start();
        op2.start();
    }
}
```

**Method 3: Lambda with Runnable** (MOST CONCISE)

```java
public class CallCenter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread op1 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Handling Alice's call");
        });

        Thread op2 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Handling Bob's call");
        });

        op1.start();
        op2.start();
    }
}
```

**Method 4: ExecutorService** (PRODUCTION RECOMMENDED)

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class CallCenter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

        // Submit 100 tasks
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            final int callId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Handling call " + callId);
                try { Thread.sleep(5000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Thread Lifecycle States

A thread goes through several states during its lifetime:

<div class="mermaid">
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> NEW: Thread created<br/>(new Thread())
    NEW --> RUNNABLE: start() called
    RUNNABLE --> RUNNING: Scheduler picks thread
    RUNNING --> RUNNABLE: Yield CPU/<br/>Time slice ends
    RUNNING --> WAITING: wait()/join()/<br/>park() called
    RUNNING --> TIMED_WAITING: sleep()/wait(timeout)/<br/>join(timeout)
    RUNNING --> BLOCKED: Waiting for<br/>synchronized lock
    WAITING --> RUNNABLE: notify()/<br/>unpark()
    TIMED_WAITING --> RUNNABLE: Timeout expires/<br/>notify()
    BLOCKED --> RUNNABLE: Lock acquired
    RUNNING --> TERMINATED: run() completes
    TERMINATED --> [*]
</div>

**State Explanations:**

1. **NEW** - Operator hired but not yet on duty
```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Work"));
// Thread state: NEW (not started yet)
```

2. **RUNNABLE** - Operator ready to take calls, waiting for assignment
```java
thread.start();  // State: RUNNABLE (eligible to run)
```

3. **RUNNING** - Operator actively on a call (not a Java state, but conceptually important)
```java
// JVM/OS scheduler has given CPU to this thread
// Thread is executing its run() method
```

4. **WAITING** - Operator waiting indefinitely for something
```java
synchronized (lock) {
    lock.wait();  // State: WAITING (until notify())
}
```

5. **TIMED_WAITING** - Operator on scheduled break
```java
Thread.sleep(5000);  // State: TIMED_WAITING (for 5 seconds)
```

6. **BLOCKED** - Operator waiting to enter a locked room
```java
synchronized (resource) {  // Another thread holds this lock
    // State: BLOCKED (waiting to acquire monitor)
}
```

7. **TERMINATED** - Operator finished shift and left
```java
// run() method completed
// Thread state: TERMINATED (cannot be restarted)
```

### Monitoring Thread States

```java
public class ThreadStateDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread worker = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Working...");
            try { Thread.sleep(3000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            System.out.println("Done!");
        });

        System.out.println("State after creation: " + worker.getState());  // NEW

        worker.start();
        System.out.println("State after start(): " + worker.getState());   // RUNNABLE

        Thread.sleep(100);
        System.out.println("State while sleeping: " + worker.getState());  // TIMED_WAITING

        worker.join();  // Wait for completion
        System.out.println("State after completion: " + worker.getState()); // TERMINATED
    }
}
```

### Thread Pools - Types and Use Cases

**1. Fixed Thread Pool** - Fixed number of operators
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
// Best for: Known workload, predictable resource usage
// Example: Web server handling requests (10 concurrent requests max)
```

**2. Cached Thread Pool** - Hire/fire operators as needed
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
// Best for: Short-lived tasks, unpredictable bursts
// Warning: Can create unlimited threads (dangerous!)
```

**3. Single Thread Executor** - One operator handles all calls sequentially
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
// Best for: Tasks must execute in order
// Example: Event log writer (maintain order)
```

**4. Scheduled Thread Pool** - Operators work on schedules
```java
ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(5);
executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
    System.out.println("Periodic task");
}, 0, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
// Best for: Periodic tasks (health checks, cache cleanup)
```

**5. Custom Thread Pool** (PRODUCTION RECOMMENDED)
```java
ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    5,                      // Core pool size (minimum operators)
    10,                     // Max pool size (maximum operators)
    60L,                    // Keep-alive time (idle operators fired after 60s)
    TimeUnit.SECONDS,
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(100),  // Call queue (max 100 waiting)
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy()  // Rejection policy
);
// Best for: Production systems with fine-tuned resource management
```

### Thread Creation Cost and Why Pools Matter

**Creating a thread is expensive:**
- Allocates ~1MB stack memory per thread
- OS kernel calls required
- Context switching overhead
- JVM bookkeeping

```java
// BAD: Creating new thread for every task
public void handleRequest(Request req) {
    new Thread(() -> processRequest(req)).start();  // EXPENSIVE!
}
// Problem: If you get 10,000 requests, you create 10,000 threads!
// Result: OutOfMemoryError or system slowdown

// GOOD: Using thread pool
private ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100);

public void handleRequest(Request req) {
    pool.submit(() -> processRequest(req));  // Reuses existing threads
}
// Only 100 threads created, reused for all 10,000 requests
```

### Complete Example - Production Call Center

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class ProductionCallCenter {
    private static final int CORE_OPERATORS = 10;
    private static final int MAX_OPERATORS = 50;
    private static final int QUEUE_CAPACITY = 1000;

    private final ThreadPoolExecutor operatorPool;
    private final AtomicInteger callCounter = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public ProductionCallCenter() {
        // Custom thread pool with monitoring
        this.operatorPool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
            CORE_OPERATORS,
            MAX_OPERATORS,
            60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
            new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(QUEUE_CAPACITY),
            new CustomThreadFactory("CallOperator"),
            new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy()  // If queue full, caller handles
        );
    }

    public void handleCall(String caller, int durationSeconds) {
        operatorPool.submit(() -> {
            int callId = callCounter.incrementAndGet();
            String threadName = Thread.currentThread().getName();

            System.out.printf("[Call-%d] %s connected to %s%n",
                            callId, caller, threadName);

            try {
                Thread.sleep(durationSeconds * 1000L);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {

                System.out.printf("[Call-%d] Interrupted!%n", callId);
                return;
            }

            System.out.printf("[Call-%d] %s finished (handled by %s)%n",
                            callId, caller, threadName);
        });
    }

        }

        @Override
        public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
            Thread t = new Thread(r, namePrefix + "-" + threadNumber.getAndIncrement());
            t.setDaemon(false);
            return t;
        }
    }

## Where the Analogy Breaks Down

1. **Operators need training** - Threads don't require initialization beyond construction
2. **Operators can refuse difficult calls** - Threads must execute their assigned Runnable
3. **Operators multitask** - Threads execute one Runnable at a time (though can be reused)
4. **Managers decide staffing** - In Java, YOU must explicitly create threads (unless using frameworks)
5. **Operators have skills** - Threads are generic executors (no specialization)

---

## Best Practices

### When to Create Threads

**Create threads when:**
- You have truly independent, parallelizable work
- You're doing I/O-bound operations (file reading, network calls, database queries)
- You need concurrent processing of multiple requests
- You're building server applications handling multiple clients

**Don't create threads when:**
- Work is CPU-bound and you have more threads than CPU cores (creates contention)
- Tasks are very short-lived (overhead exceeds benefit)
- You're not sure what you're doing (use higher-level abstractions first)

### Thread Pool Sizing Guidelines

**CPU-Bound Tasks:**
```java
int threads = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
// For pure computation: thread count = CPU cores
```

**I/O-Bound Tasks:**
```java
int threads = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 2;
// For I/O operations: can use 2x CPU cores
// Because threads spend time waiting for I/O
```

**Mixed Workload:**
```java
// Formula: threads = cores / (1 - blocking_factor)
// If 50% of time is I/O (blocking_factor = 0.5):
int threads = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() / (1 - 0.5);
// = cores * 2
```

### Always Use Thread Pools in Production

```java
// ❌ BAD: Creating threads manually
public void processRequests(List<Request> requests) {
    for (Request req : requests) {
        new Thread(() -> process(req)).start();  // Resource leak!
    }
}

// ✅ GOOD: Using ExecutorService
private final ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(20);

public void processRequests(List<Request> requests) {
    for (Request req : requests) {
        executor.submit(() -> process(req));  // Managed threads
    }
}

// ✅ BETTER: Using try-with-resources
public void processRequests(List<Request> requests) {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(20);
    try {
        for (Request req : requests) {
            executor.submit(() -> process(req));
        }
    } finally {
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Handling Thread Interruption

```java
public void handleCall(String caller) {
    try {
        System.out.println("Processing call from " + caller);
        Thread.sleep(5000);  // Simulate work
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Always restore interrupt status
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        System.out.println("Call interrupted!");
        // Clean up resources
    }
}
```

## Real-World Example - Web Server

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class SimpleWebServer {
    private static final int PORT = 8080;

## TL;DR

Java threads are like call center operators. The main thread is like one operator handling all calls sequentially - slow and inefficient. Creating new threads (`new Thread().start()`) is like hiring operators for each call - works but expensive. Thread pools (`ExecutorService`) are like maintaining permanent staff on standby - efficient and scalable. Threads are created when you explicitly tell Java to create them via `new Thread()`, `ExecutorService.submit()`, or framework APIs. Threads go through lifecycle states: NEW (hired), RUNNABLE (ready), RUNNING (working), WAITING/TIMED_WAITING (on break), BLOCKED (waiting for resource), TERMINATED (finished). Always use thread pools in production to avoid the overhead of creating/destroying threads. Size pools based on workload: CPU-bound = # of cores, I/O-bound = 2x cores. Key insight: Java doesn't automatically create threads - you must explicitly spawn them, and managing them efficiently via pools is critical for performance.
