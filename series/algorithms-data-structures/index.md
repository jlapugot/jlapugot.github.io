# Algorithms & Data Structures

A comprehensive series exploring algorithms and data structures through powerful analogies. Master time complexity, algorithmic thinking, and data structure selection for technical interviews and real-world applications.

## What You'll Learn

This series covers essential algorithms and data structures for senior developers:

- Big O notation and complexity analysis
- Core data structures: arrays, lists, trees, graphs, heaps
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms
- Graph algorithms and traversals
- Algorithm optimization techniques

## Why This Series?

Algorithms and data structures are the foundation of computer science and critical for technical interviews. These posts use real-world analogies to make abstract concepts concrete and intuitive.

Each post includes:
- Visual diagrams and step-by-step explanations
- Multiple code examples with complexity analysis
- Interview tips and common patterns
- Real-world use cases

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Java or similar language)
- Understanding of basic loops and conditionals
- Familiarity with arrays and lists

## Coming Next

Future posts in this series will cover:

- Binary Search Trees and balanced trees
- Hash Tables internals and collision resolution
- Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, A*)
- Dynamic Programming patterns
- Sorting algorithms comparison
- Heaps and Priority Queues
