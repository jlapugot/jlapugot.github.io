# System Design Fundamentals

A comprehensive series exploring system design patterns and architecture through powerful analogies. Master scalability, reliability, and distributed systems for technical interviews and real-world applications.

## What You'll Learn

This series covers essential system design concepts for senior developers and architects:

- Microservices vs Monolithic architecture trade-offs
- Load balancing strategies and algorithms
- Caching layers and CDN patterns
- Database sharding and partitioning
- Message queues and event-driven architecture
- API Gateway and service mesh patterns
- Distributed system challenges and solutions

## Why This Series?

System design is critical for senior engineer and architect roles. These posts use real-world analogies to make complex distributed systems concepts intuitive and memorable:

- **Food Court vs Restaurant** explains microservices architecture
- **Traffic Patterns** illustrate load balancing strategies
- **Library Systems** demonstrate caching layers

Each post includes architectural diagrams, code examples, trade-off analysis, and real-world case studies from companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Uber.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic software architecture
- Familiarity with databases and APIs
- Experience with web applications
- Basic networking knowledge

## Coming Next

Future posts in this series will cover:

- Load balancing algorithms (Round Robin, Least Connections, Consistent Hashing)
- Caching strategies (Redis, CDN, cache invalidation)
- Database scaling (Sharding, replication, partitioning)
- Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
- API Gateway patterns
- Circuit breaker and retry patterns
- CAP theorem and eventual consistency
- Rate limiting and throttling
